The Python 3 code for pilot data preprocessing is provided in the Jupyter notebook pilot_data_preprocessing.ipynb

The R code for SBT simulations and pilot data analysis is provided in the Jupyter notebook sbt_simulation_and_pilot_analysis.ipynb

OSF provides a good built-in notebook viewer, but for running the code you would need to install Jupyter (http://jupyter.org/install.html), or, e.g., copy the code snippets to RStudio.

Keep in mind that running the simulations requires fitting Bayesian models hundreds or sometimes thousands of times. 
Therefore, running the provided code might take many hours (see warnings throughout the notebook).
